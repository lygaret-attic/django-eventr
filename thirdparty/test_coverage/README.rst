========================
Django Test Coverage App
========================

What is it?
===========
A test coverage reporting tool that utilizes `Ned Batchelder`_'s 
excellent coverage.py_ to show how much of your code is exercised with 
your tests. 

Dependencies
============
* Django_ 1.0.2 and above. It may work with earlier versions, but I 
  haven't tested anything prior to 1.0.2 explicitly. 
* coverage.py_ 2.85 or 3.0b2

How do I use it?
================
Install as a Django app
-----------------------
1. Place the entire ``test_coverage`` app in your third-party apps 
   directory. 
2. Update your ``settings.INSTALLED_APPS`` to include ``test_coverage``. 
3. Include test coverage specific settings in your own settings file. 
   See ``settings.py`` for more detail. 

Once you've completed all the steps, you'll have a new custom command 
available to you via ``manage.py test_coverage``. It works just like 
``manage.py test``. 

Use it as a test runner
-----------------------
You don't have to install ``test_coverage`` as an app if you don't want 
to. You can simply use the test runner if you like. 

1. Update ``settings.TEST_RUNNER = 
   'test_coverage.coverage_runner.run_tests'`` 
2. Include test coverage specific settings in your own settings file. 
   See ``settings.py`` for more detail. 
3. Run ``manage.py test`` like you normally do.

And that's it.

Where do I get it?
